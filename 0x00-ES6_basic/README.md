# ES6 Learning Objectives

## 1. What is ES6?
ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard. It is the scripting language specification that JavaScript is based on. ES6 brought significant enhancements to the language, providing developers with new features and syntax for writing more expressive and concise code.

## 2. New Features Introduced in ES6
ES6 introduced several key features, including:

- **let and const:** New ways to declare variables, with `let` allowing block-scoped variables and `const` for constants.
- **Arrow Functions:** A concise syntax for writing functions.
- **Rest and Spread Parameters:** Simplifies working with function parameters and arrays.
- **Template Strings:** A more readable way to concatenate strings.
- **Object Destructuring:** Extracting values from objects and assigning them to variables.
- **Classes:** A new way to create and work with them


## Conclusion
Upon completion of this project, i have a solid understanding of key ES6 features
